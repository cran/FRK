\title{Spatial Random Effects class}
\description{
This is the central class definition of the \code{FRK} package, containing the model and all other information required for estimation and prediction.
}
\details{
The spatial random effects (SRE) model is the model employed in Fixed Rank Kriging, and the \code{SRE} object contains all information required for estimation and prediction from spatial data. Object slots contain both other objects (for example, an object of class \code{Basis}) and matrices derived from these objects (for example, the matrix \eqn{S}) in order to facilitate computations.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{data}}{the original data from which the model's parameters are estimated}

\item{\code{basis}}{object of class \code{Basis} used to construct the matrix \eqn{S}}

\item{\code{BAUs}}{object of class \code{SpatialPolygonsDataFrame}, \code{SpatialPixelsDataFrame} of \code{STFDF} that contains the Basic Areal Units (BAUs) that are used to both (i) project the data onto a common discretisation if they are point-referenced and (ii) provide a BAU-to-data relationship if the data has a spatial footprint}

\item{\code{f}}{formula used to define the SRE object. All covariates employed need to be specified in the object \code{BAUs}}

\item{\code{S}}{matrix constructed by evaluating the basis functions at all BAUs affected by the data}

\item{\code{Ve}}{measurement-error variance-covariance matrix (typically diagonal)}

\item{\code{Vfs}}{fine-scale variance-covariance matrix (typically diagonal) up to a constant of proportionality estimated in the framework}

\item{\code{Z}}{vector of observations (of class \code{Matrix})}

\item{\code{Cmat}}{incidence matrix mapping the observations to the BAUs}

\item{\code{X}}{matrix of covariates}

\item{\code{mu_eta}}{updated expectation of random effects (estimated)}

\item{\code{S_eta}}{updated covariance matrix of random effects (estimated)}

\item{\code{Khat}}{prior covariance matrix of random effects (estimated)}

\item{\code{Khat_inv}}{prior covariance matrix of random effects (estimated)}

\item{\code{alphahat}}{covariates weights (estimated)}

\item{\code{sigma2fshat}}{fine-scale variation scaler (estimated)}
